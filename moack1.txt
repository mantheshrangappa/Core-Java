JVM jvm stand for java virtuval machine it is used to excuite the byte code.

3.java file is saved files which is created by the user.it will saved as a classname.java it used to represent the file of java program

.class file is the platform independent it will be provid the jvm.its conver the source code to byte code.

4.the java IDE s
vs code 
nortepad++
eclipe
anaconda


5.the variable is the store the some informaion. it uesd the allocation od address of the memory.
static variabke
non-static variable
local variable
parametr 

public class Name{
	static double hieght;
	public static void main(String[] args){
	System.out.println(hieght);
}
}


6.the object orianted java is independet platform it is sun micro system it well be used in dvelop the web basid application.
 with the hlep of object we can create the polymarpisam,inheritans,abstraction,encopslation;

8.data type is the size and diffrent values is stored the variable .
primitive data type=int,float,long,short,double,boolean,byte,char.
int=3;
float=5.0;
double=234;

non primitive =string,array,any class.
class name{
  string name;
}

9.dot operater is access the propertice and method of a class

System.out.println();

10.security
   speed
   multitasking
   exception handling
   automated garbage collection

11.array is the store the similar elements

example
int[] no={1,2.3.4,5,};

String[] name={"kiran","anill","manoj"};

12.class is the not a real word entity.it is a templet and blueprint.

example:class Tv{


}

   object is the real word entity instance of variable and living or non living things.
examle:class TV{

public static void main(String[] name){

	Tv tv=new Tv();
}

}

ex:if,public,const,private,for,class,return.

14.Constructor is a spiceal method and no retun type.
    it is an same name of the class name.
    it is usde to initialize the instance value
    Constructor is usde to new keyword
    constructor is defult or parameterized

15.it is a main method jvm will be start the execution form main method.
whenevr we runs the program jvm will first start he executi main method.

16.class chair{
	int[] no={12,3,2,45,6,7,6,};
	public static void main(string[] chair){
	for(int i=0; i<no.length;i++){
	System.out.println(i);
}

}

}

17.method is a block of code it will be execute when it has been called

class Metro{
String name;
double cost;
String color;

Metro(){
System.out.println("noi argument");
}

Metro(String name){
	this.name=name;
	System.out.println("metro name"+name);
}


}
Metro(String name.double cost){
	this.name=name;
	this.cost=cost;
	System.out.println("metro name"+name+","+cost);
}

Metro(String name.double cost,String color){
	this.name=name;
	this.cost=cost;
	this.color=color;
	System.out.println("metro name"+name+","+cost+","+color);
}

}
